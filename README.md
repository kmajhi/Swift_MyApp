Swift Language
Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple for building applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It is designed to be fast, modern, safe, and interactive, with a concise and expressive syntax that makes it easy to read and write.

Swift is also open-source, meaning that developers from around the world can contribute to its development and improvement. Since its release in 2014, Swift has become increasingly popular among developers due to its ease of use and its ability to help create high-quality, performant applications.
